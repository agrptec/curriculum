# Projects

## VisionCity

- Feb 2023 – present
- We have a subscription-based platform integrating computer vision for occupancy, trajectories, and activities, using existing surveillance cameras. The platform also incorporates custom environmental sensors, and we are developing a multimodal sensor (radar + vision) for analyzing urban space usage. With a TRL 4, our project aims to create healthy, sustainable, and successful urban spaces, with a growth projection as a startup, having already participated in incubators.
- Acceleration funding - Coramino Acceleration Funding from Jose Cuervo Foundation
- Credits funding - AI for Good Open Call from Microsoft

## Adaptation of the GTAModel V4 for the Monterrey Metropolitan Area
